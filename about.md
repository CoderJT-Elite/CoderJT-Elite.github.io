## A Little Bit About Me

I'm John, a passionate web developer. I specialize in creating websites using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, and exploring new places. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and expand my knowledge.
